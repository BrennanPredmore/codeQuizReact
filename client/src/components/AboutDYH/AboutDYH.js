          Do Your Homework is a five piece hardcore punk band from Austin,
          Texas. The band was formed in 2017 by four original members: Brennan
          Predmoré, Matt Boyd, Luke Barry, and David Robin. Later in 2018, they
          would add Chris Lansford a new member. The final line up was Brennan
          Predmoré on drums, Matt Boyd and David Robin on guitar, Chris Lansford
          on bass and Luke Barry on vocals.
          <br />
          Throughout the course of the next three years the band would play many
          shows and go on 2 different Texas tours. DYH put out their first album
          “Harder Not Smarter” in 2018 which included 9 hard hitting tracks and
          was distributed on over 200 platforms worldwide as well as hard copy
          CD’s. Their 2nd full length album “If They Came To Hear Me Beg” is due
          to be released in 2021 which is their greatest work yet.
          <br />
          In 2020 the band has been on hiatus due to covid and hopes to still
          play shows when venues and live shows come back to fruition.
